This repository contains code, source data and a memo that I produced for a data journalism class taught by Sarah Cohen at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.

For this project, I downloaded data for the Armed Conflict and Event Location Data Project (ACLED) and analyzed it using R tidyverse to find potential stories with a local (Arizona) angle.

I identified tracked recruiting activities by an organization called the Yavapai County Preparedness Team.

The repository contains my data analysis as well as a short "pitch" I wrote based on my data reporting and other research.
